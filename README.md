# Software testing

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/hennatee/Software-testing/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/hennatee/Software-testing?branch=main) ![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/hennatee/Software-testing.svg?branch=main)

Testing an open-source JavaScript utility library. The library is to be used in developing the front-end of an E-commerce food product store. Testing was done to gather information on how well the library works - if it does what it claims to do â€“ and whether the library contains any noticeable defects.

Target library: COMP.SE.200-2021-2022-1 (submodule).

Due to time constraints, testing was conducted on a limited part of the library. Ten classes were chosen as targets for testing. Directory src/.internal/ was excluded.

Unit-spesific test reports can be found from mochawesome-report directory.
