# Software testing

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/hennatee/Software-testing/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/hennatee/Software-testing?branch=main)

Testing an open-source JavaScript utility library. The library is to be used in developing the front-end of an E-commerce food product store. Testing is done to gather information on how well the library works - if it does what it claims to do â€“ and whether the library contains any noticeable defects.


Due to time constraints, testing will be conducted on a limited part of the library. Ten classes have been chosen as targets for testing.
